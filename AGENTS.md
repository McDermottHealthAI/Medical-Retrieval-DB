# LLM AGENT Guidelines

Please see and follow all of the guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.

In addition, please follow the test-driven-development (TDD) approach to adding new features and fixing bugs.
This means that you should first add tests that demonstrate the desired behavior (or the bug), and then
implement the feature or fix the bug to make the tests pass. You are encouraged to also check in with the user
once the verification tests has been written (but is still failing) before implementing a fix, to verify that
the behavior you have identified truly captures the desired need.
