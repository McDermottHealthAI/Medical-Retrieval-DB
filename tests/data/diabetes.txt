This is a sample medical document about diabetes management.

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). 
There are two main types: Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing 
cells in the pancreas. This type usually develops in children and young adults.

Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce 
enough insulin. This is the most common type and often develops in adults.

Management strategies include:
- Regular blood sugar monitoring
- Healthy diet and exercise
- Medication as prescribed by healthcare providers
- Regular check-ups with healthcare team
