This document discusses hypertension (high blood pressure) treatment options.

Hypertension is a common condition where the force of blood against artery walls 
is consistently too high. It's often called the "silent killer" because it 
typically has no symptoms until it causes serious health problems.

Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mmHg. Hypertension is diagnosed when 
blood pressure consistently measures 130/80 mmHg or higher.

Treatment approaches include:
1. Lifestyle modifications:
   - Reducing sodium intake
   - Regular physical activity
   - Maintaining healthy weight
   - Limiting alcohol consumption
   - Quitting smoking

2. Medications:
   - ACE inhibitors
   - Angiotensin II receptor blockers
   - Diuretics
   - Beta-blockers
   - Calcium channel blockers

Regular monitoring and follow-up with healthcare providers is essential for 
effective hypertension management.
